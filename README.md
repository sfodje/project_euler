#Project Euler

This repo contains my solutions to questions found on https://projecteuler.net
Started this as a means to practice TDD and my solutions are still a work in progress.
All solutions are written in the Go programming language.

##Installation
```
go get github.com/sfodje/project_euler/...
```

##Usage
```
$ project_euler -problem=5
Problem 5: Smallest multiple of all numbers (1 to 20) = 232792560

$ project_euler -problem=2 -end=7
Problem 2: Sum of even fibonacci numbers 4,000,000 and below = 4613732
Problem 3: Largest prime factor of 600851475143 = 6857
Problem 4: Largest palindrome from product of 2 3-digit numbers = 906609
Problem 5: Smallest multiple of all numbers (1 to 20) = 232792560
Problem 6: Difference between the square of sum and sum of squares (1 to 100) = 25164150
Problem 7: 10001th prime number = 104743
